## No Longer Maintained
This game is no longer being worked on. While I love the concept of the game, my programming skills have substantially improved since
the time I was working on this game in college. Instead of writing new code for the project, I'd rather start from scratch using
signifigantly better programming practicies and a different language than JavaScript.

# Huggable Zombies
## A web based top-down game where you can feed zombies marshmallows

## About the game
Hello and welcome to Huggable Zombies!  This is a game I have been creating to expand my knowledge with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.
The game is currently in development and is not complete yet.  However, it is in a playable state if you want to try it!
Huggable Zombies is a non-violent arena top-down shooter.  You play as someone who is claustrophobic and doesn't like confined spaces.
Unfortunately there is a zombie invasion currently going on.  These zombies are not deadly as they don't eat brains.  Instead they
like to give out lots of hugs when they are hungry!  While this might be considered friendly for most people, it is a huge concern for
our claustrophobic protagonist.  Luckly our protagonist knows their favorite food, marshmallows!  Armed with a marshmallow firing gun,
it is your job to assist the protagonist in feeding the zombies before they try to give you hugs.

## Objective of the game
There are 100 waves of huggable zombies that you must help the claustrophobic protagonist feed.  If a zombie touches the protagonist, it
will decrease their mental health bar.  If the protagonist runs out of health, they will have a panic attack and you will have to restart the 
wave over.  The protagonist will gain experience levels as they feed zombies, which can be used to upgrade the protagonist and marshmallow gun!
Near the start of the game, you may select a primary and secondary firing mode for the marshmallow gun out of the four different firing modes.

## Firing Modes
Pistol  - Semi-Auto.  Highly accurate.  Good for feeding zombies in the distance and has a fast reload.  Lower Calories Per Second (CPS).<br>
Rifle   - Full-Auto.  Somewhat accurate.  Has a good CPS and a good general purpose weapon.  Doesn't excel at one particular task.<br>
Shotgun - Full-Auto.  Poorly accurate.  Very high CPS as it fires multiple marshmallows per shot.  Bad at feeding zombies in the distance.<br>
Sniper  - Semi-Auto.  Marshmallows can travel through zombies, allowing the marshmallow to feed all zombies in its path.  Good for group feeding.<br>

## Game Dictionary
Health - The protagonist's mental health.  Running out causes a panic attack and the wave to be lost.  Hugging zombies lowers health.<br>
Sprint - Allows the protagonist to move faster for a limited amount of time.  Can sprint by holding "Shift".<br>
Mag - How many marshmallows are loaded in the marshmallow gun.  Can be reloaded by pressing "R".<br>
Level - The protagonist's level.  Increases from feeding zombies.<br>
Calories - The amount a marshmallow feeds a zombie.  Typically known as damage in other games.<br>
CPS - Stands for "Callories Per Second".  How many calories can be delivered per second.  Known as DPS or "Damage Per Second" in other games.<br>
Fire Rate - How fast the marshmallows can be fired out of the marshmallow gun.  Number is based on how many marshmallows can be fired each second.<br>
Accuracy - How accurate the marshmallows will fire where the mouse is pointed.<br>
Mouthshot - A term when a marshmallow shot from the marshmallow gun perfectly lands in the zombies mouth.  Known as a critical hit in other games.<br>
Mouthshot Chance - The odds that a marshmallow fired from the marshmallow gun will land in a zombies mouth as a mouthshot.<br>
Mouthshot Multiplier - A multiplier for the amount of calories the zombie will injest.<br>
Sight Range - The distance the player can see around the area.  A larger percentage zooms out and makes everything smaller, increasing the game area.<br>
Game Area - The space the protagonist can move around in to avoid hugs from the zombies.<br>
AoE - Area of Effect.  Certain enemies will create AoE spots in the game area that decreases your health.<br>
Game Boarder - The edges of the game area.  If the protagonist goes outside of the game boarder their health will decrease.<br>
